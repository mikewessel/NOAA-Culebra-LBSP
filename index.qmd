This site provides links and instructions for using google forms to enter water quality data for both the "Nearshore" and "Watershed" components of NOAA's Ridge to Reef monitoring program in Culebra, Puerto Rico. 

## Instructions

* Print datasheets for sampling each month. The file in the link provided at the end of this paragraph contains datasheets for both the sonde measurements as well and the laboratory nutrients and bacteriological sampling. 

There are 8 sites in the Watershed sampling components that are to be sampled monthly so print 8 datasheets using the following link [Watershed Datasheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17oZ_msC6d49UCro2x92w2r4P4DCnu0YX/edit)

There are 13 sites in the Nearshore sampling components that are to be sampled monthly so print 13 datasheets using the following link [Watershed Datasheets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17oZ_msC6d49UCro2x92w2r4P4DCnu0YX/edit)
